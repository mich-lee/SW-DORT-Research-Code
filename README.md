# SW-DORT-Research-Code
A repository containing code I wrote for testing synthetic wavelength DORT (SW-DORT).  SW-DORT is explained in my thesis.  See my thesis repository, which is located at [https://github.com/mich-lee/michael-joseph-s-lee-ms-thesis], for more information.

# Notes
- ***A good place to start would be the scripts in the ``THESIS EXPERIMENTS`` folder.***
- Notes on scripts
  - Scripts starting with "Generate_Data"
    - These scripts generate data files containing data
      - These data files contain the transfer matrix along with other data (e.g. data needed to perform backpropagation)
    - One defines an optical system in these scripts
    - A transfer matrix that relates the system input to the system output is computed
  - Scripts starting with "Analyze_Data"
    - These scripts analyze the data generated by scripts starting with "Generate_Data"
    - DORT and backpropagation of signals derived from DORT is performed
    - Processing with synthetic wavelengths can also be performed
    - Various results can be plotted
  - Scripts starting with "SetupTestingPlayground"
    - These scripts are meant to help test setups for the scripts starting with "Generate_Data"
- Notes on the ``holotorch-lib`` folder
  - The code in this thesis relies on a modified version of the [Holotorch library](https://github.com/facebookresearch/holotorch), which was stored in the ``holotorch-lib`` folder
  - The ``holotorch-lib`` is not contained in this repository.  It is contained at https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork
  - Download the repository at https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork and have that repository as the 'holotorch-lib' folder
  - ***Make sure to use the most recent https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork commit that is dated at or before the commit on this repository (https://github.com/mich-lee/SW-DORT-Research-Code/) that you are using***
    - At the time of writing, Commit 16772c500acd761ab7756767b4167888257249d2 on https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork would be the commit to use (assuming that one is working with the most recent commit on this repository, i.e. https://github.com/mich-lee/SW-DORT-Research-Code)

## IMPORTANT NOTE
The 'holotorch-lib' folder is contained in this repository: https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork
To use the code in this repository, download that repository (https://github.com/mich-lee/holofork) and have that repository be the 'holotorch-lib' folder.
See the notes above for more information.
